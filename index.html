        <h3>A funny story</h3>
        <p class="story">There doesn't really come a funny story to mind at the moment...
            But maybe a long time ago when I was laughing really hard during a lesson of French the friend sitting next to me threw a piece of eraser in my mouth, and the only option was to swallow it.
            Before I knew it I had to give them my agenda and got a detention. I still don't understand till this day why I got the detention and not my friend who threw the piece of eraser.
            But it's fine though, I'm OKE with it... I think...</p>
